# **SPICY SMASHED POTATOES WITH SRIRACHA MAYO**

We’re going to be really bold here and say these are possibly the nicest way to eat a potato! Being Irish potatoes have a very special place in our hearts, some say we eat so many potatoes they are flowing in our blood and these are so magnificent, so crispy, crunchy and they are the middle ground where crispy meat a potato with a lovely sweet spiciness!

## INGREDIENTS

Ingredients;
1 kg new or baby potatoes
½ tsp Salt
¼ tsp Pepper
Sauce;
4 tbsp Olive oil
1 tbsp Sriracha optional
1 tbsp Tamari
½ Tbsp Maple syrup
1 tsp Garlic powder
Sriracha mayo to serve;
2 tbsp of sriracha sauce
5 tbsp of mayo

## INSTRUCTIONS

Preheat oven to 200 C Fan
In a saucepan boil the potatoes for 15-20 mins. They are cooked when a knife pierces easily to the centre, but not falling apart.
Transfer the cooked potatoes to a baking tray, gently smash them to crack open slightly by flattening with the base of a glass/mug or pot. Be careful here not to smash them to much but to ensure that they open up. What you are trying to do here is to get them to release some of the starchy insides as when this gets coated in a little oil and is baked it goes so wonderfully crispy. Drizzle the oil mixture evenly over the veg, giving the tray a shake to coat the veg in the oil, sprinkle evenly with the salt and pepper. Roast for 25 – 30 minutes in the preheated oven until golden and super crispy. Serve with a spicy sriracha mayo.
For the Sriracha mayo simply mix together, this makes a great dip to accompany the crispy potatoes!
